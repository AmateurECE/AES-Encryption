# An Encryption Library #
Written in C and Assembly, this library takes advantage of some of the advanced
features that your hardware contains, delivering incredibly fast and compliant
AES encryption tools on x86-64. The library is also meant to be easy to port to
embedded computers. It relies only on the C standard library, so that you can
tailor it to the needs of your embedded system.

# A Command Line Tool #
The library can also be built with a command line interface, which allows you to
encrypt binary, ascii, or any other type of file with a single command.

## News ##
The library hasn't been finished yet. Updates will be put here as more work is
completed on it. New features will be noted here.
